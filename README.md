 <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this module we will be utilizing SQLite with the the intention of carrying out the same analytical work with SQL and databases but in a more compact manner. With SQLite we use less memory, no users, and more readily available for users on variopus platforms/devices. We will be carrying out an analysis of opening a surf shop in Hawaii however, we must break down weather data that may or may not impede the area therefore impede business and flow of customers/tourists. Ww will ephasize our data on two specifics months June and December. <br />
