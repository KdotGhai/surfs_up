## <br />Overview
 <br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this module we will be utilizing SQLite with the intention of carrying out the same analytical work with SQL and databases but in a more compact manner. With SQLite we use less memory, no users, and more readily available for users on various platforms/devices. We will be carrying out an analysis of opening a surf shop in Hawaii however, we must break down weather data that may or may not impede the area therefore impede business and flow of customers/tourists. We will emphasize our data on two specifics months June and December. <br />
 ## Results:
   <br />![June Description](Resources/June_decription.png)<br />
   <br /> ![December description](Resources/December_deccription.png)<br />
  - In December we can see that we have more ideal conditions as both the count and standard deviation are higher than June inidcating lower levels of precipitation
  - The minimum in June is at 64 and in December the minimum is at 56, clearly to June is too volatile to operate business in and preferably December is has a more ideal season
  - Standard deviation is 3.25 in June and 3.75 -- making a .5 difference in the two different seasons 
## Summary
<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall, itâ€™s clear that its preferable to operate in the second half(closer to December) of the year as precipitation levels are much less in the second half of the year. The business cannot risk operating in the first half(Closer to June) as precipitation levels are drastically high indicating storms or monsoons are a natural occurrence. If the business is to thrive it would only have to operate for 4-5 months or reconsider its second functionality of being an ice cream shop as well since that aspect cannot be fulfilled all year round or not even half the year.
